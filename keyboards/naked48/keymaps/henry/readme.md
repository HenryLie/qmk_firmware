# _henrylie_'s colemak layout

This keymap is `henrylie`'s Colemak layout for Naked48 keyboard, but treats it as 36 keys keyboard instead. This is revision 9.1 of the layout.

- `9` denotes the revision version of this layout.
- `.1` denotes the workaround version because somehow the json that comes from QMK Configurator has `cmd` and `ctl` keys swapped (mostly).
